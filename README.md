  ## Chinese Speech Map Analysis Platform Based on MATLAB  
  Course project of Digital Audition Processing  
  Date: Nov.2017  
  Tongji University
  
### Eight methods of analysis included:
##### 1. Time & frequency domain analysis on vowel, consonant
##### 2. Spectragram
##### 3. Time domain analysis of speech signal
##### 4. Voiced, unvoiced comparison
##### 5. Frequency domain analysis of speech signal
##### 6. Homomorphic processing of speech signal
##### 7. LPC linear prediction
##### 8. Variable speed constant tune, variable tune constant speed
### Instructions:
  Make sure that Matlab Version is lower than 2014a  
  1. Open a project folder in matlab  
  2. Click on ".fig" file, which will lead you to Matlab GUI
  3. Load the ".wav" files to be analyzed  
  4. Execute and get the corresponding result
  5. An Introdution manual is provided for guidance
### How to deal with errors on "wavread":
  1. Set view options as "Show hidden files, folders and drivers"  
  2. If corresponding "._wav" files can be found, the wavread function will be able to read .wav files  
  3. For MATLAB in English only version, please change all the file name to english name
